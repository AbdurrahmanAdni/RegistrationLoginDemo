# Reason why my design is better than current Dr. Tania onboarding process
Because I don't use email in the registration form. In the registration form, the user will enter a telephone number, will be verified by OTP, then the user will get a verification code to enter the next registration stage. I also use Firebase in creating this login and registration page. In addition, I also added background to the login and registration page. I hope that the registration and login that I make also minimizes the user's efforts to log in and register. I also pay attention to the Android lifecycle and empty the activity stack at a point with the aim of minimizing the use of smartphone resources.

# If there's some problem in registration
If there's some problem in registration using phone number. Please use this number <Indonesia>858-2233-4455 and then fill the verification code using this code : 998877. After that, you'll enter the profile registration page.
